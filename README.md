This joke generator was created soon after my first API-based project, my [Weather App](https://github.com/dannykryan/soc3-weatherApp), simply because I had heard of the dad joke api and I was keen to give it a try and see if I could make something that made my little nephews laugh!
Soon after showing it off for the first time, I realised I needed to filter out some of the more risky jokes in order to protect the innocent so I included a NSFW button so that users can toggle the naughtier jokes when children might be present.
